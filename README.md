# MSB (Multi-Sites Browsing)

MSB is a split-screen web app that lets you open multiple websites side-by-side in vertical panels. Start with 2–4 splits, type your URLs, and keep everything in view at once.

## Features
- Choose 2 to 4 vertical panels on the start page.
- Each panel has its own URL input and navigation.
- Close any panel to reflow and reload the remaining panels.
- Per-panel mute controls (best-effort for embedded media providers).
- About page and GNU GPL v3.0 license.

## Development
```
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Deployment
MSB is built with Next.js and deploys cleanly to Vercel. Connect the repository and use the default Next.js build settings.

## License
GNU GPL v3.0. See `LICENSE` for details.
